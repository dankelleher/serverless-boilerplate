## Serverless Boilerplate

A boilerplate codebase for serverless projects using the Serverless Framework.


This code is set up for the following:
- ES6 syntax (webpack + babel)
- Unit testing with mocha and chai
- Integration testing with newman

I suggest you run `yarn upgrade` before starting work on this.
